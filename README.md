# learningdart

This project is my "learningdart" repo based off Chapter 3 - Introduction to Dart
from: 
- [37 hour flutter course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8)

Included in the dart code for this program are: 
* keywords (reserved words)
* data types, see (A tour of the Dart language)[https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour]
* constants
* variables
* finals 
* functions
* function arguments/parameters 
* curly brackets for function body 
* formatting strings 
* Dart string formatting
* function shorthand in Dart, =>, instead of using curly brackets.

Notes: 
There is a convention in Dart that your code should be in camel case per [Vandad ](https://www.youtube.com/c/vandadnp). 
Dart can make a string using single or double quotes, like JavaScript. 
After saving code, Ctrl + S in Windows, the code is hot reloaded, and updated code is run.  
String formatting in Dart, e.g. '$firstName $lastName' is like string interpolation in C#. 
Note in Dart, curly brackets are preferred instead of using => shorthand.
