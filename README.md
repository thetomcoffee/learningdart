# learningdart

This project is my "learningdart" repo based off Chapter 3 - Introduction to Dart
from: 
- [37 hour flutter course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8)

Included in the dart code for this program are: 
* constants
* variables
* finals 
* functions
* function arguments/parameters 
* curly brackets for function body 
* formatting strings 


Note, there is a convention in Dart that your code should be in camel case per [Vandad ](https://www.youtube.com/c/vandadnp). 
Also, Dart can make a string using single or double quotes, like JavaScript.
